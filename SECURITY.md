# Security Guidelines for HA ESCPOS Thermal Printer Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the HA ESCPOS Thermal Printer integration to ensure secure operation and protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

The integration implements comprehensive input validation to prevent injection attacks and resource exhaustion:

- **Text Input Validation**: All text inputs are validated for length limits and sanitized to remove control characters
- **URL Validation**: Image URLs are validated against allowed schemes and patterns
- **File Path Validation**: Local image paths are checked for path traversal attempts
- **Numeric Input Validation**: All numeric parameters are validated within safe bounds

### 2. Security Scanning Tools

The project includes automated security scanning as part of the development and CI/CD process:

- **Safety**: Scans Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- **Bandit**: Performs static analysis to detect common security issues in Python code
- **pip-audit**: Audits installed packages for known vulnerabilities
- **Ruff Security Rules**: Includes security-focused linting rules

### 3. Secure Coding Practices

#### Input Validation
```python
# Example of secure input validation
from .security import validate_text_input, validate_numeric_input

text = validate_text_input(user_input)
feed_lines = validate_numeric_input(feed_param, 0, MAX_FEED_LINES, "feed lines")
```

#### Secure Logging
```python
# Example of secure logging that prevents information disclosure
from .security import sanitize_log_message

log_msg = sanitize_log_message(
    f"Processing data: {data}",
    ["password", "token", "key"]
)
_LOGGER.debug(log_msg)
```

#### Resource Limits
- Maximum text length: 10,000 characters
- Maximum QR data length: 2,000 characters
- Maximum barcode data length: 100 characters
- Maximum image download size: 10MB
- Maximum feed lines: 50
- Maximum beep repetitions: 10

## Security Configuration

### Bandit Configuration (.bandit)
```ini
[bandit]
exclude_dirs = ["tests", ".git", "__pycache__", ".pytest_cache", ".mypy_cache", ".ruff_cache"]
skips = ["B101", "B601", "B603", "B607"]
```

### Ruff Security Rules (pyproject.toml)
```toml
[tool.ruff]
select = [
    "S",      # flake8-bandit (security)
    # ... other rules
]
```

## CI/CD Security Integration

### GitHub Actions Security Workflow
The project includes automated security scanning in CI/CD:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Runs on every push and pull request
2. **Code Security Analysis**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
3. **Automated Reporting**: Security findings are reported and can block merges
4. **Scheduled Scans**: Weekly comprehensive security scans

### Running Security Scans Locally

#### Quick Security Scan
```bash
python scripts/security_scan.py
```

#### Individual Security Tools
```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scan
safety check --full-report

# Python security linting
bandit -r custom_components/escpos_printer

# Dependency audit
pip-audit
```

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- All network communications use timeout limits
- Image downloads are restricted to HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- No sensitive data is transmitted in URLs or headers

### File System Security
- Local file access is restricted to allowed image formats
- Path traversal attacks are prevented through validation
- Temporary files are properly cleaned up

### Resource Protection
- Input size limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Rate limiting considerations for service calls
- Memory usage is monitored and limited

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in this integration:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security contact information]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response and fixes

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Configuration Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for printer access
- Restrict network access to printers when possible
- Regularly update printer firmware
- Monitor printer access logs

### Operational Security
- Limit user access to printing services
- Implement logging and monitoring
- Regularly review and rotate credentials
- Keep the integration and dependencies updated

### Network Security
- Use firewalls to restrict printer network access
- Implement VPNs for remote printer access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Use HTTPS for web-based image sources

## Security Testing

### Unit Tests for Security
```python
def test_input_validation():
    # Test input validation functions
    with pytest.raises(HomeAssistantError):
        validate_text_input("x" * 10001)  # Exceeds max length
```

### Integration Tests for Security
```python
def test_path_traversal_protection():
    # Test path traversal protection
    with pytest.raises(HomeAssistantError):
        validate_local_image_path("../../../etc/passwd")
```

## Compliance and Standards

This integration follows security best practices aligned with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web application vulnerabilities
- **Python Security Best Practices**: Following PEP 508 and secure coding guidelines
- **Home Assistant Security Guidelines**: Compliance with HA integration security requirements

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Security Updates
- Dependencies are regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities
- Security scans are run weekly to identify new issues
- Critical security patches are applied promptly

### Security Monitoring
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Regular code reviews with security focus
- Dependency monitoring for security advisories
